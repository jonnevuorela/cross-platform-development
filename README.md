### Getting to know the tool


Last time I left on after initializing the new flutter app and looked up the tools used on flutter development.

Flutter sdk seems intuitive, but the official quick start guide was weird to say at least. The instructions doesn't say a thing on anything else than installing and using VS Code, despite they having a perfectly fine CLI tool that is easy to use.
Kinda same as you would be in a market for a new car and start looking into Mercedes-Benz and the dealer tells you to go get a taxi ride as they probably drive a new Mercedes.

Delving deeper in to the ecosystem here I see handy tools in the web interface DevTools. It brings comfort in knowing that the sdk provides niceties from the web dev into play.

### Initialization

Going into this courses completion, I'll state that I already do have some experience in cross-platform development. I've priorly used React Native for mobile app development and Tauri for desktop app development in my personal learning projects. 

After the initial lecture of the course, and looking more into the options presented on the lecture, I've drawn a conclusion about the technology I want to use on this course. 
Much like the frameworks I mentioned earlier, many other cross-platforms also tend to cater towards enforcing the usage of familiar web technologies to develope native applications and that doesn't feel like a option that would interest me right now. 
So the most interesting technology to me on the table is the one that was kinda default already on the course, Flutter.
Flutter seems most versatile tool to me since it's capabilities in making most native apps out of the options and yet still compiling also to web format. Also since I do have tried out the two second most interesting options already, I figured why not.
